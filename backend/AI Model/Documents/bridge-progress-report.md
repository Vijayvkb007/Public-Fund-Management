## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report details the progress made on the MahaKumbh Bridge Construction Project utilizing the first funding installment of ₹250 crore. The bridge, spanning the Sangam area where the Ganga and Yamuna rivers meet, is designed to accommodate the massive footfall expected during the next MahaKumbh festival. Phase 1 of the project has been successfully implemented, with all allocated funds utilized judiciously and efficiently, focusing on preliminary works, design, procurement, foundation construction, and community engagement.

Key achievements during this phase include:
- Completion of comprehensive technical surveys and environmental impact assessments
- Finalization of engineering designs and project blueprints
- Procurement of essential construction materials and specialized equipment
- Construction of 8 out of 28 planned bridge foundations
- Implementation of effective stakeholder engagement and community outreach programs

The project is currently on schedule and within budget, with no major deviations from the original implementation plan. We are now ready to proceed to Phase 2, requiring the release of the second funding installment of ₹250 crore.

## 2. PROJECT BACKGROUND

The MahaKumbh festival, one of the largest religious gatherings in the world, faces significant logistical challenges, particularly regarding crowd movement across the rivers. During the last MahaKumbh, over 120 million pilgrims faced difficulties crossing the Sangam area, resulting in dangerous overcrowding on existing pontoon bridges and ghats.

The new permanent bridge project aims to:
- Provide safe passage for up to 300,000 pedestrians per hour
- Create a 1.2 km span connecting the main festival grounds
- Incorporate disaster management features and emergency evacuation capabilities
- Serve as long-term infrastructure benefiting the region beyond festival periods

The total project cost is estimated at ₹1,000 crore, divided into four phases of ₹250 crore each.
